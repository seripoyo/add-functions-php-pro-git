Please submit images of functions you would like to see implemented here.
    - However, please note that your submission may not necessarily be reflected in the update.
- What should I do if I cannot use WordPress due to an error when using the plugin?
    
    If you can no longer login or operate WordPress by using this plugin, please follow the steps below to disable this plugin. 1.
    
    1. make sure that you can browse the files installed in WordPress from FTP software or the server panel of your contracted server. 2.
    2. access the /plugins directory directly under the /wp-content directory, and confirm the existence of the /add-functions-php directory. 3.
    Rename the /add-functions-php directory to something arbitrary (e.g., no-add-functions-php). 4.
    4. check the admin screen of WordPress again, because the plugin will be disabled by changing the directory name. 5.
    If the error is not resolved by this process, we will not be able to help you because the cause is other plug-ins.
